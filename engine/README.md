# Engine

Goals for the engine:
- Multiplatform: you can use the same game code and run it on a desktop screen, a web browser,
  or another platform.
- Simple and understandable: no feature is too mysterious, error messages are clear and descriptive
- Safe: leverages Rust's cool type system

An entity-component-system game engine.
